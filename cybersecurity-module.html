                    <strong>Did you know?</strong> 95% of cybersecurity breaches are caused by human error. This means most security incidents are preventable through awareness and proper practices.

                <p>In today's digital workplace, every employee plays a critical role in protecting organizational assets. Cybersecurity isn't just the IT department's responsibility‚Äîit's everyone's job. A single clicked link, weak password, or mishandled document can compromise sensitive data, disrupt operations, and damage your organization's reputation.</p>
                
                <p>This module will equip you with practical knowledge to protect yourself and your organization from common cyber threats in your daily work.</p>

                <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                <p><strong>Passwords</strong> are your first line of defense against unauthorized access. However, weak or reused passwords are one of the easiest ways for attackers to gain access to your accounts and organizational systems.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong> adds an extra layer of security by requiring two or more verification factors to access an account. Even if someone steals your password, they won't be able to access your account without the second factor.</p>
                
                <div class="concept-list">
                    <h4>Types of Authentication Factors:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Something you know</strong> (password, PIN)</li>
                        <li><strong>Something you have</strong> (phone, security token, smart card)</li>
                        <li><strong>Something you are</strong> (fingerprint, face recognition)</li>

                <div class="scenario-box">
                    <h4>Scenario 1: The Reused Password Disaster</h4>
                    <p><em>Sarah uses the same password "Summer2023!" for her email, work account, and online shopping. A retail website gets breached, and hackers obtain her credentials. Within hours, they access her work email and send phishing messages to her entire team.</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts, especially work accounts.</p>
